The chief minister has referred to Shivpal as “chachu” in his remarks. Speaking in the budget session of the UP assembly, Shivpal Singh said he was firmly with the PDA – a term used by SP leaders referring to people belonging to the backward classes (‘pichde’ in Hindi), Dalits and minorities (‘alpsankhyak’). The Leader of the House (the CM) sometimes gets worried about me. It seems that he is doing chacha pe charcha Shivpal said";
